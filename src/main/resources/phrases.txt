1/Kael’thas Sunstrider/Don’t look so smug! I know what you’re thinking, but Tempest Keep was merely a setback. Did you honestly believe I would trust the future to some blind, half-night elf mongrel? Hahahaha… Oh no, no, no, he was merely an instrument, a stepping stone to a much larger plan! It has all led to this…and this time, you will not interfere!
2/Prince Valanar/Naxxanar was merely a setback!
3/Lady Deathwhisper/You have found your way here, because you are among the few gifted with true vision in a world cursed with blindness.
4/Deathbringer Saurfang/Join me, father. Join me and we will crush this world in the name of the Scourge -- for the glory of the Lich King!
5/The Lich King/No questions remain unanswered. No doubts linger. You are Azeroth's greatest champions! You overcame every challenge I laid before you. My mightiest servants have fallen before your relentless onslaught, your unbridled fury... Is it truly righteousness that drives you? I wonder.
